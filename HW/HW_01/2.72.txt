A.
sizeof() returns a number of type size_t, which is unsigned. When an unsigned variable and
a signed variable are added together, the result is always an unsigned variable. Because
unsigned variables must be >= 0, the result of maxbytes-sizeof(val) >= 0 always returns true.
B.
The if conditional can be rewritten as:
	if(maxbytes - (int) sizeOf(val) >= 0)
	{
		//unaltered code here
	}
