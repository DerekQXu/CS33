A.
x is held in register %rdi. However, x is also copied into and TEMPORARILY stored in 
register %r8 (r8 later is altered to hold the bit vector equivalent to 'x&mask').
n is held in %esi. However, n is also copied into register %ecx.
result is held in %rax.
mask is held in %rdx.

B.
result's initial value is 0 (line 4 of assembly code)
mask's intial value is 1 (line 3 of assembly code)

C.
The test condition is: mask != 0

D.
Mask's update: mask = mask << (n & 0xFF);

E.
Result's update: result |= x&mask;

F.
As taken from loop.c . . .
long loop(long x, long n)
{
    long result = 0;
    long mask;
    for (mask = 1; mask != 0; mask = mask << (n&0xFF)){
        result |= (x&mask);
    }
    return result;
}
